## R Markdown

Let $(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{X})$ be the data of $n$ observations, where $\mathbf{y}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is the vector of the response variable and $\mathbf{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$ is the matrix of $p$ covariates. 


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
